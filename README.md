# VanillaJSDemo

## Synopsis

A simple pure Javascript solution to basic component reuse, routing, sass, ES6 and the build tool, `Gulp`.

## Motivation

This project was first inspired by a company asking me to write this in vanilla js as a test for employment.  I took it as an opportunity to see what could be done with pure JS in this world of multiple JS frameworks.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dreadrocksean/VanillaJSDemo.git
$ git checkout feature/ES6
$ npm i
$ gulp
```

For pure ES5 Javascript and CSS with no bells and whistles omit
```
$ git checkout feature/ES6
```
Or if you have already executed it, do
```
$ git checkout master
```
. . . then just reload the browser.
